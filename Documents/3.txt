What are the most expensive and cheapest cities and regions in Denmark and Finland?
Copenhagen is the most popular, and most expensive place to visit in Denmark. Because Denmark is such a small country, most visitors spend the majority of their time in Copenhagen. Everything from food to accommodation can be expensive. Making reservations well in advance and booking any train or ferry tickets can help you keep your costs in check.

Finland is an expensive country to visit, but more affordable than Denmark. Helsinki is a relatively expensive city, but it is possible to find some reasonably prices hostels and budget hotels. In particular, Lapland is an expensive area, in part because visitors often book organized activities and excursions before they arrive. These activities and excursions can be very expensive and raise your overall daily budget. If you're hoping to save some money, do some research and figure out what you can do independently, which is often the cheaper way to go.
