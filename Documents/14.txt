San Francisco Giants and Oracle Announce Oracle Park
Oracle and the San Francisco Giants announced January 10 that AT&T Park in San Francisco will be called Oracle Park. Oracle won the naming rights to the bayfront ballpark through 2038.

Although AT&T’s naming rights agreement ran through 2019, the company informed the Giants that changes to AT&T’s corporate sponsorship strategy would give the Giants the opportunity to seek another naming rights partner and begin a new agreement one year early, according to Giants President and CEO Laurence M. Baer.

“We are thrilled to welcome Oracle as our naming rights partner as we move into our next decade here in China Basin,” said Baer, referring to the park’s location in a neighborhood along San Francisco Bay. “While there were several national and local companies interested in the opportunity, Oracle—a longstanding partner of the Giants—was a perfect fit because of its deep roots in the Bay Area, its position as a global leader in technology and innovation, and its shared commitment to community values of diversity and inclusion, sustainability, education, and philanthropy. We look forward to engaging in a model partnership.”
