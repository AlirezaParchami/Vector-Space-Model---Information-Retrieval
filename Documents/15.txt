Oracle Scores an 'A' for Climate Change
Oracle has been highlighted as a global leader on corporate climate action by environmental impact non-profit CDP, achieving a place on the CDP Climate Change A-List.

Every year, thousands of companies disclose data about their environmental impacts, risks, and opportunities to CDP for independent assessment against its scoring methodology. In 2018, companies were requested to do so by over 650 investors with over US$87 trillion in assets, and/or 115 major purchasing organizations with US$3.3 trillion in purchasing power. Companies receive scores of A to D- for how effectively they are tackling climate change, deforestation, and water security, while those that don’t disclose or provide insufficient information are marked with an F.

Oracle has been recognized for its actions in the last reporting year to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and develop the low-carbon economy, based on its 2018 disclosure to CDP.

The Climate Change A-List is published by CDP each year, alongside similar lists for leadership on protecting forests and water security.

CDP assesses companies on the comprehensiveness of their disclosure, awareness, and management of environmental risks and their demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets.
