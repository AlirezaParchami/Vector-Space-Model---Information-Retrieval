IBM extends cloud services with SoftLayer acquisition
IBM is accelerating its push into cloud computing with the acquisition of SoftLayer Technologies for an undisclosed sum.

The Dallas-based company SoftLayer is reportedly the largest privately held cloud service in the world, with an estimated worth of around $2 billion according to reports from the Wall Street Journal.

Softlayer has 13 data centers in the US, Europe and Asia that will become the foundation for a new IBM Cloud Service division, which, along with IBM’s SmartCloud Franchise, will allow the company to begin to challenge Amazon’s dominance in providing cloud services.
